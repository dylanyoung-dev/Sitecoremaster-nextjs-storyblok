# Welcome

Welcome to the source that drives my personal blog.  Forever I ran this site on Wordpress, with grand plans to move this to a Sitecore implementation.  But a change of plans and using a free version of Storyblok and using a modern Headless SaaS CMS tool instead.  May role in Sitecore CDP, Send and Order Cloud at some point in the future, but for now keeping with the basics.

## Planned Implementations

- Next.js 12 / React (obviously)
- Storybook for UI Styleguide
- Storyblok for CMS
- Vercel for Hosting
- TypeScript

## Getting Started

Run the following command after you've git cloned this repository to your local machine.

```bash
npm install
```

### Story Book

```bash
npm run storybook
```

### Website

To run the site on your local machine run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
